# Cardinal
A complicated but personalized and configurable server architecture written in C/C++, Python, and Rust. 

## Notes
The `start.sh` and `start.bat` files are currently under construction but should eventually provide an easy client start.

## Future Plans
- [ ] Write a website that executes python code in a python environment on my server that I only have access to so I can run my code tests from school on the school computers
- [x] Incorporate hash message verification
- [ ] Create an easy-to-use client API to allow other programs to easily communicate with the server.
- [ ] Set up the server responses with specific information through the request protocol.
- [ ] Set up a PySQL database to host user information and traffic data.
